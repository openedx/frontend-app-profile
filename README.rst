********
Purpose
********

This is a micro-frontend application responsible for the display and updating of user profiles.

When a user views their own profile, they're given fields to edit their full name, location, primary spoken language, education, social links, and bio.  Each field also has a dropdown to select the visibility of that field - i.e., whether it can be viewed by other learners.

When a user views someone else's profile, they see all those fields that that user set as public.

Getting Started
***************

Installation
============

Follow these steps to provision, run, and enable an instance of the
Profile MFE for local development via the `devstack`_.

.. _devstack: https://github.com/openedx/devstack#getting-started

#. To use this application, `devstack <https://github.com/openedx/devstack>`__ must be running and you must be logged into it.

   * Start devstack
   * Log in (http://localhost:18000/login)

#. To run Profile, install requirements and start the development server by running:

.. code-block::

  1. Clone your new repo:

    ``git clone https://github.com/openedx/frontend-app-profile.git``

  2. Use node v18.x.

    The current version of the micro-frontend build scripts support node 18.
    Using other major versions of node *may* work, but this is unsupported.  For
    convenience, this repository includes an .nvmrc file to help in setting the
    correct node version via `nvm <https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm>`_.

  3. Install npm dependencies:

    ``cd frontend-app-profile && npm ci``

  4. Start the dev server:

    ``npm start``
     The server will run on port 1995

Once the dev server is up, visit http://localhost:1995/u/staff.

Configuration
=============

This MFE is configured via node environment variables supplied at build time. See the .env file for the list of required environment variables. Example build syntax with a single environment variable:

.. code-block::

   NODE_ENV=production ACCESS_TOKEN_COOKIE_NAME='edx-jwt-cookie-header-payload' npm run build
